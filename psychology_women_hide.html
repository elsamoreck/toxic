        <div class="intro">
            <h2>🧠 The Secrets They'll Never Tell You</h2>
            <p>Women won't tell you these psychological truths because they're uncomfortable, politically incorrect, or because they don't even consciously realize them. But understanding these hidden patterns is the key to breaking free from nice guy syndrome forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="truth-bomb">
            <h3>💣 The Brutal Reality</h3>
            <p>Everything you've been taught about what women want is wrong. The "be nice, be yourself, treat her like a queen" advice has destroyed more dating lives than it's helped. Time to learn what actually drives female attraction.</p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="psych-title">She's Attracted to Men Other Women Want</h3>
            
            <div class="psych-content">
                This is called "preselection" and it's one of the most powerful forces in female psychology. Women are biologically wired to want men who other women find attractive—it's social proof that he has valuable genes and resources.

            <div class="what-she-thinks">
                <h4>💭 What She's Really Thinking</h4>
                <p>"If other women want him, there must be something special about him that I'm missing. I need to figure out what makes him so desirable."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="what-she-wont-say">
                <h4>🤐 What She Won't Say</h4>
                <p>"I'm more attracted to you when I see you talking to other attractive women" or "Your complete availability makes you less appealing to me."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="nice-guy-mistake">
                <h4>❌ The Nice Guy Mistake</h4>
                <p>You make yourself completely available to her, ignore other women, and essentially broadcast that no other woman wants you. This kills attraction instantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reality-check">
                <h4>💡 The Reality</h4>
                <p>The man who has options but chooses her is infinitely more attractive than the man who has no options and clings to her. Scarcity creates value, abundance creates desire.</p>

            <div class="psych-content">
                Women want to feel like they earned your affection through their charm, beauty, and personality. When you give your interest away too easily, it feels cheap and unearned.

                <p>For thousands of years, women had to compete for the best men. This competition created a psychological need to "win" a man's affection. Easy victories feel hollow.</p>
